# Principia Mathematica in Lean

Source-critical Lean edition of Whitehead and Russell's *Principia
Mathematica*. The first canonical target is the first edition (1910–1913).

The project keeps distinct: the historical English text, a typed abstract
syntax reproducing PM, derivations in a reconstructed PM calculus, and
interpretations or metatheorems proved in Lean.

Every item retains its original starred number and page-level provenance. A
proof is accepted only after Lean and CI checks, with no `sorry`, `admit`, unsafe
escape hatch, or unrecorded axiom.

Aristotle credentials must exist only in `ARISTOTLE_API_KEY` or the macOS
Keychain. They must never occur in tracked files, prompts, manifests, logs,
archives, or command-line arguments.
